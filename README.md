# 💻 FreeCodeCamp's Relational Database Course Projects
Projects made along the certification course that helped me learn PostgreSQL commands directly from the terminal and Bash scripting using shell syntax.  
I learned how to use PostgreSQL using the terminal only, strenghtening my database administration knowledge.
Also learned various bash commands to help me use the teminal much more confortably.  
This repository is used as proof of my efforts to get the related certification.
