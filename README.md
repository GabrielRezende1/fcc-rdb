# 💻 FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification Projects
Projects made along the certification course that helped me learn PostgreSQL commands directly from the terminal and Bash scripting using shell syntax.  
I learned how to use PostgreSQL using the terminal only, strenghtening my database administration knowledge.
Also learned various bash commands to help me use the teminal much more confortably.
